The documents highlight several important considerations:\n\n1. Privacy-Preserving AI Techniques:\n   - Federated learning enables collaborative model training across clients without sharing raw data, enhancing privacy (Document 1).\n   - Quantum teleportation can be integrated into federated learning frameworks to further bolster privacy by leveraging quantum entanglement and the no-cloning theorem (Document 1).\n   - Differential privacy is considered the gold standard for privacy-preserving machine learning, providing strong quantitative guarantees (Document 6).\n\n2. Balancing Explainability and Privacy:\n   - There is a need to reconcile the \"Right-to-Privacy\" (RTP) and \"Right-to-Explanation\" (RTE) requirements in high-stakes AI applications (Document 6).\n   - Post-hoc explainers can be used to audit AI models and provide explanations, while operating independently of the model training process (Document 6).\n\n3.

      "traditional_rag_summary": "Based on the retrieved documents, here is how companies can balance innovation with privacy in AI:\n\nThe key is to find ways to reconcile the need for privacy and the need for explainability in AI systems, especially in high-stakes applications. The documents highlight a few key considerations:\n\n1. Differential privacy: This is considered the \"gold standard\" for privacy-preserving machine learning, as it provides strong quantitative guarantees of privacy. Companies should look to incorporate differential privacy techniques into their AI models and systems.\n\n2. Post-hoc explainers: These are important for model auditing and providing the \"right to explanation\" for AI decisions. However, the documents note that evaluating these explainers under differential privacy constraints is complex and requires careful analysis.\n\n3. Transparency and consent: When using AI models and data for training, companies need to be transparent about their practices and obtain proper consent from users. The documents highlight legal and ethical considerations around data use and model integration in end-to-end encrypted systems.\n\n4. Proactive risk assessment: Companies should proactively assess the potential risks and misuse cases of their AI systems, especially in sensitive domains like biology and medicine.
