# GraphRAG vs Traditional RAG - Comprehensive Evaluation Report

## Executive Summary

We conducted a comprehensive evaluation comparing GraphRAG (Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation) against Traditional RAG using 160 carefully crafted queries across 8 different categories. This evaluation was designed to assess the strengths and limitations of both approaches using an impartial LLM judge (Claude) with blind evaluation protocols.

## Evaluation Framework

### 📊 Query Design
- **Total Queries**: 160 evaluation queries
- **Categories**: 8 distinct categories (20 queries each)
  - AI/ML Research (20 queries)
  - Company Technology (20 queries)
  - Cross-domain Connections (20 queries)
  - Research Trends (20 queries)
  - Technical Deep Dive (20 queries)
  - Industry Applications (20 queries)
  - Comparative Analysis (20 queries)
  - Future Directions (20 queries)

### 🎯 Evaluation Criteria
Each query was evaluated across 6 comprehensive criteria:
1. **Completeness**: How thoroughly the summary addresses all aspects of the query
2. **Accuracy**: Factual correctness and reliability of information
3. **Contextual Depth**: Relevant background and context provided
4. **Clarity**: Structure and readability of the response
5. **Relevance to Query**: Direct and specific answering of the question
6. **Actionable Insights**: Usefulness for decision-making

### 🔍 Methodology
- **Blind Evaluation**: LLM judge does not know which method generated each summary
- **Scoring Scale**: 1-10 points for each criterion
- **Confidence Assessment**: Judge provides confidence score (1-100) for each decision
- **Automated Pipeline**: Systematic evaluation across all 160 queries

## Data Sources and System Configuration

### Knowledge Graph Data
- **Entities**: 473 nodes (Companies, People, Technologies, Topics, Documents)
- **Relationships**: 24 relationship types connecting entities
- **Domain Coverage**: AI/ML research, technology companies, academic publications

### Document Collection
- **Total Documents**: 1,529 embeddings in ChromaDB
- **Source Types**:
  - Research Papers (ArXiv + Semantic Scholar): 300+ papers
  - News Articles: 72 articles from tech publications
  - GitHub Repositories: 156 AI/ML repositories
  - Company Blog Posts: Research content from major tech companies

### Technology Stack
- **GraphRAG**: Neo4j knowledge graph + ChromaDB vector store + entity extraction
- **Traditional RAG**: ChromaDB vector similarity search only
- **LLM Judge**: Claude 3 Haiku for impartial evaluation
- **Embedding Model**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
